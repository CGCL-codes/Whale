/**
 * Assign partitions in a round robin fashion for all spouts,

 * the spouts does not typically change while running this makes
 * the assignments more stable in the face of crashing spouts.
 * <p/>
 * Round Robin means that first spout of N spouts will get the first
 * partition, and the N+1th partition... The second spout will get the second partition and
 * N+2th partition etc.
